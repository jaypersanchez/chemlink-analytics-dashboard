## ✅ What the Query Does

**Query #10 from engagement-platform.sql** shows:

```sql
WITH user_engagement AS (
    SELECT 
        p.id,
        p.first_name || ' ' || p.last_name as full_name,
        p.email,
        p.company_name,
        p.external_id,
        -- Engagement metrics
        (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM posts WHERE person_id = p.id AND deleted_at IS NULL) as post_count,
        (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM comments WHERE person_id = p.id AND deleted_at IS NULL) as comment_count,
        (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM group_members WHERE person_id = p.id AND deleted_at IS NULL) as group_memberships,
        (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mentions WHERE mentioned_person_id = p.id AND deleted_at IS NULL) as mentions_received,
        p.created_at
    FROM persons p
    WHERE p.deleted_at IS NULL
)
SELECT 
    full_name,
    email,
    company_name,
    external_id,
    post_count,
    comment_count,
    group_memberships,
    mentions_received,
    -- Calculate engagement score
    (post_count * 3 + comment_count * 2 + group_memberships + mentions_received) as engagement_score,
    -- Engagement level
    CASE 
        WHEN (post_count + comment_count + group_memberships) > 5 THEN 'HIGHLY_ENGAGED'
        WHEN (post_count + comment_count + group_memberships) > 0 THEN 'MODERATELY_ENGAGED'  
        ELSE 'NOT_ENGAGED'
    END as engagement_level,
    created_at
FROM user_engagement
ORDER BY engagement_score DESC, post_count DESC;
```

## 🔍 What This Query Returns

### Example Output:

| Name | Posts | Comments | Engagement Score | Level |
|------|-------|----------|------------------|-------|
| Sarah Chen | 45 | 120 | 375 | HIGHLY_ENGAGED |
| Mike Johnson | 32 | 85 | 266 | HIGHLY_ENGAGED |
| Lisa Park | 18 | 45 | 144 | HIGHLY_ENGAGED |
| Tom Wilson | 8 | 15 | 54 | MODERATELY_ENGAGED |
| Jane Doe | 2 | 5 | 16 | MODERATELY_ENGAGED |

**What each column means:**
- **Posts**: How many posts they've created
- **Comments**: How many times they've commented
- **Engagement Score**: Weighted score (posts count more than comments)
- **Level**: Category based on total activity

---

## 🧮 How the Engagement Score Works

### The Formula:
```
Engagement Score = (Posts × 3) + (Comments × 2) + Group Memberships + Mentions
```

**Why weighted?**
- **Posts × 3**: Creating content is hardest, most valuable
- **Comments × 2**: Engaging with others is valuable
- **Groups × 1**: Joining groups shows interest
- **Mentions × 1**: Being mentioned shows influence

**Example calculation:**
```
User has:
- 10 posts
- 20 comments  
- 3 group memberships
- 5 mentions received

Score = (10 × 3) + (20 × 2) + 3 + 5
      = 30 + 40 + 3 + 5
      = 78 points
```
