# Sessions Per User - Alternatives & Workarounds

## 🎯 Business Pain Point
**"We can't measure user stickiness - are users coming back regularly or is it mostly one-time visits?"**

---

## ⚠️ The Challenge
**Sessions Per User** requires the same session tracking infrastructure as Average Session Duration.

**Bottom line:** If we don't have session tracking, we can't count sessions directly.

---

## 🔄 Same Problem, Same Solution Path

### Option 1: Build Full Session Tracking
**Requirements:** Same as Average Session Duration
- 4-6 weeks development effort
- Authentication system integration
- New database table or schema changes
- Frontend/backend instrumentation

**Once built, this query would work:**
```sql
-- Sessions per user (requires session tracking)
SELECT 
    person_id,
    COUNT(*) as total_sessions,
    COUNT(*)::float / EXTRACT(days FROM MAX(started_at) - MIN(started_at)) as sessions_per_day
FROM user_sessions
WHERE started_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY person_id
ORDER BY total_sessions DESC;
```

---

## 💡 Alternative Approach: Use Proxy Metrics

### What We CAN Measure Today (Without Session Tracking):

### 1. **Active Days Per User**
**Concept:** Count how many different days a user was active

```sql
-- Days with activity (proxy for sessions)
WITH user_activity AS (
    SELECT person_id, DATE(created_at) as active_day FROM posts
    UNION
    SELECT person_id, DATE(created_at) FROM comments
    UNION
    SELECT person_id, DATE(updated_at) FROM persons WHERE updated_at > created_at
)
SELECT 
    person_id,
    COUNT(DISTINCT active_day) as active_days_last_30,
    COUNT(DISTINCT active_day)::float / 30 as avg_active_days_per_month
FROM user_activity
WHERE active_day >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY person_id
ORDER BY active_days_last_30 DESC;
```

**What this tells us:**
- How many days per month users engage with the platform
- Who our most consistent users are
- User retention patterns

**Why it works as a proxy:**
- If someone is active 20 days out of 30 = highly engaged
- If someone is active 2 days out of 30 = low engagement
- Good enough to measure "stickiness"

---

### 2. **Activity Frequency Per User**
**Concept:** Count total actions as a proxy for engagement

```sql
-- Total interactions per user (proxy for session activity)
WITH user_actions AS (
    SELECT person_id, 'post' as action_type, created_at FROM posts
    UNION ALL
    SELECT person_id, 'comment', created_at FROM comments
    UNION ALL
    SELECT person_id, 'search', created_at FROM query_embeddings
    UNION ALL
    SELECT person_id, 'collection', created_at FROM collections
)
SELECT 
    person_id,
    COUNT(*) as total_actions,
    COUNT(DISTINCT DATE(created_at)) as active_days,
    COUNT(*)::float / COUNT(DISTINCT DATE(created_at)) as actions_per_active_day
FROM user_actions
WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY person_id
ORDER BY total_actions DESC;
```

**What this tells us:**
- Total engagement level (more actions = more engaged)
- Intensity of usage (actions per day)
- Power users vs. casual users

---

### 3. **Return Visit Pattern**
**Concept:** Track gaps between activities to infer return visits

```sql
-- Time between activities (proxy for return frequency)
WITH user_activity_timeline AS (
    SELECT 
        person_id,
        created_at as activity_time,
        LAG(created_at) OVER (PARTITION BY person_id ORDER BY created_at) as prev_activity
    FROM (
        SELECT person_id, created_at FROM posts
        UNION ALL
        SELECT person_id, created_at FROM comments
        UNION ALL
        SELECT person_id, created_at FROM query_embeddings
    ) all_activity
)
SELECT 
    person_id,
    COUNT(*) as total_activities,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN activity_time - prev_activity > INTERVAL '1 hour' THEN 1 END) as estimated_sessions,
    AVG(EXTRACT(epoch FROM (activity_time - prev_activity)) / 3600) as avg_hours_between_activities
FROM user_activity_timeline
WHERE activity_time >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
    AND prev_activity IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY person_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
ORDER BY estimated_sessions DESC;
```

**What this tells us:**
- Estimated number of "return visits" (gaps > 1 hour = new session)
- How often users come back
- Usage patterns (daily vs. weekly visitors)

## 🎯 What to Say in Your Update

### Simple Version:
**"Sessions per user requires the same session tracking infrastructure as session duration. Without it, we'll use proxy metrics: active days per month, total actions per user, and return visit patterns. These give us similar insights about user stickiness and engagement without the development overhead."**

### Detailed Version:
**"True session counting needs 4-6 weeks of development for session management. As an alternative, we can measure user stickiness using existing activity data: counting active days (are they on the platform 5 days a month or 25?), tracking action frequency (how many posts/comments/searches), and analyzing time gaps between activities to estimate return visits. These proxy metrics answer the same business question - 'are users coming back?' - without requiring new infrastructure."**

## 📋 Comparison Table

| Metric Approach | Data Required | Dev Effort | Accuracy | Business Value |
|----------------|---------------|------------|----------|----------------|
| **True Sessions Per User** | Session tracking | 4-6 weeks | High | High |
| **Active Days Per Month** | Existing activity | None | Medium | High |
| **Actions Per User** | Existing activity | None | Medium | High |
| **Return Visit Pattern** | Existing activity | 1-2 days | Medium | Medium |

---

## ✅ Recommended Approach

### Phase 1 (Immediate):
Use **Active Days Per Month** as your primary "stickiness" metric
- Zero development effort
- Works with existing data
- Answers the business question: "Are users coming back?"

### Phase 2 (Mid-term):
Add **Return Visit Pattern** analysis
- Simple query on existing data
- More granular view of engagement frequency
- Helps segment users (daily/weekly/monthly)

### Phase 3 (Long-term):
Build **Full Session Tracking** only if:
- Business requires precise session counts
- You need real-time session monitoring
- Other session-dependent features are planned (e.g., session-based recommendations)

---

## 💭 Key Insight

**"Sessions per user" is really asking: _"How sticky is our platform?"_**

You can answer that question WITHOUT counting actual sessions:
- Users active 20+ days/month = Very sticky ✅
- Users active 3 days/month = Not sticky ❌

The proxy metrics give you the business insight without the technical complexity.

*Start with what you can measure today. Build sophisticated tracking only when the business clearly needs that level of precision.*
