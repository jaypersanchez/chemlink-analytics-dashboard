## 1. GROWTH METRICS - Query Mapping

### 🟢 **New Users**
**Business Pain Point:** *"We don't know if our marketing efforts are working or how fast we're acquiring users compared to competitors"*

| Aspect | Status | Details |
|--------|---------|---------|
| **Existing Query** | ✅ Ready | Query #9 (finder-builder): User registration tracking |
| **Schema Data** | ✅ Complete | `persons.created_at` available |
| **Query Quality** | ✅ Good | Can track daily/weekly/monthly new users |
| **Modifications** | ✅ None needed | Time-series grouping ready |

**Sample Enhancement:**
```sql
-- Weekly new users (ready to use)
SELECT 
    DATE_TRUNC('week', created_at) as week,
    COUNT(*) as new_users
FROM persons 
WHERE deleted_at IS NULL
GROUP BY week ORDER BY week DESC;
```

### 🔴 **Monthly Active Users (MAU)**
**Business Pain Point:** *"We can't tell if users are actually using our platform regularly or just signing up and abandoning it"*

| Aspect | Status | Details |
|--------|---------|---------|
| **Existing Query** | ❌ Missing | No query available |
| **Schema Data** | ❌ Missing | No `last_login_at` or session data |
| **Query Quality** | ❌ N/A | Cannot track without login timestamps |
| **Modifications** | 🔨 Schema change needed | Add login tracking to persons table |

**Required Schema Addition:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE persons ADD COLUMN last_login_at TIMESTAMP;
ALTER TABLE persons ADD COLUMN login_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0;
```

### 🔴 **Daily Active Users (DAU)**
**Business Pain Point:** *"We have no visibility into daily engagement patterns or which days/features drive the most activity"*

| Aspect | Status | Details |
|--------|---------|---------|
| **Existing Query** | ❌ Missing | No query available |
| **Schema Data** | ❌ Missing | No session or daily activity tracking |
| **Query Quality** | ❌ N/A | Requires session management system |
| **Modifications** | 🔨 New table needed | Complete session tracking system |

### 🟡 **User Growth Rate**
**Business Pain Point:** *"We can't measure if our growth is accelerating, stagnating, or declining month-over-month for investor/board reporting"*

| Aspect | Status | Details |
|--------|---------|---------|
| **Existing Query** | 🟡 Partial | Query #9 has base data |
| **Schema Data** | ✅ Complete | `persons.created_at` available |
| **Query Quality** | 🟡 Needs enhancement | Manual calculation required |
| **Modifications** | 🔧 Query enhancement | Add growth rate calculation |

**Enhanced Query:**
```sql
-- Growth rate calculation (needs enhancement)
WITH monthly_users AS (
    SELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', created_at) as month,
           COUNT(*) as new_users
    FROM persons WHERE deleted_at IS NULL
    GROUP BY month
)
SELECT month, new_users,
       LAG(new_users) OVER (ORDER BY month) as prev_month,
       ROUND(((new_users - LAG(new_users) OVER (ORDER BY month)) * 100.0 / 
              LAG(new_users) OVER (ORDER BY month)), 2) as growth_rate_pct
FROM monthly_users ORDER BY month DESC;
```
