# ChemLink Analytics - Data Feasibility Analysis

**Date:** October 27, 2025  
**Analyst:** Jay Persanchez  
**Status:** Requirements Assessment  
**Timeline:** Multi-day implementation planned

---

## Executive Summary

This document analyzes the feasibility of implementing requested analytics features based on available production data. Analysis conducted against:
- **Database:** `chemlink-service-prd` (Finder/Builder data)
- **Database:** `engagement-platform-prd` (Social/posts data)
- **Server:** `chemonics-global-liveus-prd-rds` (RDS Production)
- **Access:** Read-only via `chemlink-readonly` user

---

## 1. Growth & Interaction Metrics

### 1.1 Session Duration ❌ NOT FEASIBLE

**Requirement:** Track how much time users spend on the platform

**Current Data:**
- ✅ Activity timestamps available (`posts.created_at`, `comments.created_at`, `audit_logs.created_at`)
- ❌ No dedicated session tracking (login/logout times, session IDs, page views)

**What's Missing:**
```sql
-- Ideal table structure (NOT in current DB)
sessions (
  id uuid,
  person_id uuid,
  started_at timestamp,
  ended_at timestamp,
  last_activity_at timestamp,
  ip_address varchar,
  user_agent varchar
)
```

**Options:**

| Option | Feasibility | Effort | Accuracy |
|--------|------------|--------|----------|
| **A. Estimate from activity clustering** | ✅ Possible | Medium | Low (30-40%) |
| **B. Add session tracking to app** | ✅ Recommended | High | High (95%+) |
| **C. Implement Google Analytics** | ✅ Recommended | Low | High (90%+) |

**Option A - Estimate Approach:**
```sql
-- Group activities within 30-minute windows as "sessions"
WITH activity_stream AS (
  SELECT person_id, created_at, 'post' as type FROM posts
  UNION ALL
  SELECT person_id, created_at, 'comment' FROM comments
  UNION ALL
  SELECT person_id::uuid, created_at, audit_logs.type FROM audit_logs
)
-- Calculate time gaps between activities
-- Assumption: >30 min gap = new session
```

**Limitations of Option A:**
- Cannot track passive browsing (no activity = invisible)
- Assumes continuous activity = engagement
- No page view data
- Estimated accuracy: 30-40%

**Recommendation:** 🟡 **Option C (Google Analytics)** for immediate need, **Option B (Backend session tracking)** for long-term solution

### 1.2 Account Creation Drop-off Funnel ✅ FULLY FEASIBLE

**Requirement:** Track at which point users drop off during account creation

**Current Data:**
- ✅ `persons` table with profile completeness indicators
- ✅ `experiences`, `education`, `embeddings` for enrichment tracking
- ✅ `posts` for first engagement milestone

**Available Funnel Stages:**

```
Stage 1: Account Created
  └─ persons.created_at IS NOT NULL
  
Stage 2: Basic Info Added
  └─ first_name, last_name, email filled
  
Stage 3: Profile Details
  └─ headline_description, career_goals, location_id filled
  
Stage 4: LinkedIn Connected
  └─ linked_in_url IS NOT NULL
  
Stage 5: Experience Added
  └─ EXISTS(SELECT 1 FROM experiences WHERE person_id = persons.id)
  
Stage 6: Education Added
  └─ EXISTS(SELECT 1 FROM education WHERE person_id = persons.id)
  
Stage 7: Finder Enabled
  └─ has_finder = true AND EXISTS(SELECT 1 FROM embeddings)
  
Stage 8: First Post Created
  └─ EXISTS(SELECT 1 FROM posts WHERE person_id = persons.id)
```

**Sample Query:**
```sql
WITH funnel AS (
  SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total_accounts,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE first_name IS NOT NULL) as added_name,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE headline_description IS NOT NULL) as added_headline,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE location_id IS NOT NULL) as added_location,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE linked_in_url IS NOT NULL) as connected_linkedin,
    COUNT(DISTINCT e.person_id) as added_experience,
    COUNT(DISTINCT ed.person_id) as added_education,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE has_finder = true) as enabled_finder
  FROM persons p
  LEFT JOIN experiences e ON p.id = e.person_id AND e.deleted_at IS NULL
  LEFT JOIN education ed ON p.id = ed.person_id AND ed.deleted_at IS NULL
  WHERE p.created_at >= '2025-01-01'
    AND p.deleted_at IS NULL
)
SELECT * FROM funnel;
```

**Recommendation:** ✅ **Implement immediately** - All data available

voter_id        bigint         -- Who performed action
search_key      text           -- Search identifier
actual_query    text           -- Original query
score           numeric        -- Relevance score
created_at      timestamp
```

**Metrics Available:**

SELECT intent, COUNT(*) as search_count
FROM query_embeddings 
WHERE deleted_at IS NULL
GROUP BY intent
ORDER BY search_count DESC;

-- Active Finder users
SELECT 
  COUNT(DISTINCT voter_id) as active_users,
  COUNT(*) as total_interactions
FROM query_votes 
WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;

-- Search engagement rate
SELECT 
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM query_votes WHERE deleted_at IS NULL) * 100.0 / 
  NULLIF((SELECT COUNT(*) FROM query_embeddings WHERE deleted_at IS NULL), 0) 
  as engagement_rate_pct;
```

**Recommendation:** ✅ **Implement immediately** - Excellent data quality

added_by        bigint         -- Who added it
created_at      timestamp
```

**Metrics Available:**
- ✅ Total profiles added to collections
- ✅ Most collected profiles (top talent)
- ✅ Average profiles per collection
- ✅ Collection activity over time
- ✅ Power users (who collects most)

**Sample Queries:**
```sql

  COUNT(DISTINCT cp.collection_id) as unique_collections
FROM collection_profiles cp
JOIN persons p ON cp.person_id = p.id
WHERE cp.deleted_at IS NULL
GROUP BY p.id, p.first_name, p.last_name, p.email
ORDER BY times_collected DESC
LIMIT 20;

-- Average profiles per collection

  AVG(profile_count) as avg_profiles_per_collection,
  MAX(profile_count) as largest_collection
FROM (
  SELECT collection_id, COUNT(*) as profile_count
  FROM collection_profiles
  WHERE deleted_at IS NULL
  GROUP BY collection_id

## 3. Database Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

### Collections Feature
```
persons (id)
    ↓ creates
collections (person_id → persons.id)
    ↓ contains
collection_profiles (
    collection_id → collections.id,
    person_id → persons.id,  -- profile added
    added_by → persons.id    -- who added
)
    ↓ shared via
collection_collaborators (
    collection_id → collections.id,
    person_id → persons.id,  -- who has access
    added_by → persons.id    -- who shared
)
```

### Finder Feature
```
persons (id)
    ↓ performs
query_embeddings (search queries)
    ↓ rates results
query_votes (
    profile_id → persons.id,  -- profile rated
    voter_id → persons.id     -- who voted
)
```

## 5. Technical Requirements

### Database Access
- ✅ Read-only access established
- ⚠️ Need SELECT grants on tables (currently have schema visibility only)
- ✅ Connection to both `chemlink-service-prd` and `engagement-platform-prd`

### Missing Grants (Required)
```sql
-- Required for implementation
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO "chemlink-readonly";
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO "chemlink-readonly";
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA public GRANT SELECT ON TABLES TO "chemlink-readonly";
```

### Infrastructure
- ✅ Flask backend ready
- ✅ Chart.js frontend ready
- ✅ VPN access to production RDS
- ✅ `.env` configuration complete

1. ✅ **Get SELECT permissions** from DBA
2. ✅ **Implement Account Drop-off Funnel** (highest business value)
3. ✅ **Implement Finder Metrics** (shows feature adoption)
4. ✅ **Implement Collections Metrics** (collaboration insights)

### Short-term (Week 2)
5. 🟡 **Add session duration estimate** (with accuracy disclaimer)
6. 🟡 **Create data validation scripts** (verify query accuracy)
7. 🟡 **Build automated testing** (prevent data quality issues)

### Long-term (Beyond 2 weeks)

## 9. Next Steps

1. **Request SELECT permissions** (blocker for all work)
2. **Validate data quality** (run sample queries)
3. **Build queries** (start with funnel analysis)
4. **Create API endpoints** (Flask routes)
5. **Build charts** (Chart.js visualizations)
6. **Test with production data** (verify accuracy)
7. **Document limitations** (especially session duration)
8. **Deploy to premium branch** (keep separate from basic)
