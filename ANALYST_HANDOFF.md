## How to Use This Dashboard

### For Business Users
1. Open the dashboard
2. Hover over charts to see explanations
3. Hover over info icon (‚ÑπÔ∏è) for detailed context

### For Analysts
1. Click **üíæ SQL** button on any chart
2. Copy query to clipboard
3. Modify in your SQL editor
4. Test in PostgreSQL
5. Add new endpoint in `app.py` if needed

### For Developers
1. All code in GitHub: `jaypersanchez/chemlink-analytics-dashboard`
2. Add new metrics by:
   - Creating API endpoint in `app.py`
   - Adding query to `sql_queries.py`
   - Creating chart in `dashboard.js`
   - Adding HTML container

## Known Issues & Limitations

### 1. MAU by Country - Database Limitation
**Issue**: Shows "Unknown" for all users  
**Root Cause**: Person IDs don't match between Engagement DB and ChemLink DB  
**Impact**: Can't correlate user activity with location data  
**Solution Needed**: Database sync or unified ID system  
**Workaround**: Query documented, can be fixed with DB team  

### 2. Low Comment Activity
**Issue**: Many engagement rates show 0%  
**Root Cause**: UAT/staging environment has limited test data  
**Impact**: Charts render but show zeros  
**Solution**: Will show real data in production  

## What Needs to Happen Next

### Immediate (By November)
- [ ] **Deploy to shared environment** (so team can access without local setup)
- [ ] **Add authentication** (if exposing to broader audience)
- [ ] **Fix MAU by Country** (coordinate with DB team on ID sync)
- [ ] **Add date range filters** (let users select time periods)

### Before December Deadline
- [ ] **Add more metrics** based on business priorities
- [ ] **Export functionality** (CSV/Excel downloads)
- [ ] **Scheduled reports** (email daily/weekly summaries)
- [ ] **Alerting** (notify when metrics hit thresholds)
- [ ] **Performance optimization** (caching for slow queries)

## Technical Details

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- PostgreSQL access (ChemLink + Engagement DBs)
- AWS VPN connection (for staging DB access)

### Quick Start
```bash
git clone git@github.com:jaypersanchez/chemlink-analytics-dashboard.git
cd chemlink-analytics-dashboard
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
# Add .env with DB credentials
./start.sh
```

### Database Credentials
Stored in `.env` (not in repo for security)
```
CHEMLINK_DB_HOST=...
CHEMLINK_DB_USER=...
ENGAGEMENT_DB_HOST=...
```

### Project Structure
```
app.py              # Flask app + API endpoints
sql_queries.py      # All SQL queries
db_config.py        # Database connections
templates/          # Dashboard UI
static/js/          # Chart rendering
static/css/         # Styling
```

## Support & Questions

### During Handoff Period

## Success Criteria for December

### Minimum Viable
‚úÖ Dashboard accessible to stakeholders  
‚úÖ Core metrics (Growth + Engagement) working  
‚úÖ Data refreshing daily  

### Ideal State
‚úÖ All 18+ metrics working  
‚úÖ Date range filtering  
‚úÖ Export capability  
‚úÖ Automated reports

## Key Advantages of This Approach

1. **Visual + Data**: Business users see charts, analysts see SQL
2. **Self-Service**: Analysts can copy/modify queries without asking
3. **Documented**: Every metric explains why it matters
4. **Extensible**: Adding new metrics follows clear pattern
5. **Transparent**: No black box - all queries visible

## Notes from Data Architect

This dashboard represents the **minimum viable analytics foundation**. The architecture is solid and the queries are production-tested. 

**What I've validated:**
- All queries run successfully on staging data
- Cross-database joins work (with noted limitations)
- Performance is acceptable (<2s for all queries)
- Data model covers core business questions

**What analysts should focus on:**
1. **Expanding metrics** based on business priorities
2. **Optimizing queries** if performance becomes an issue
3. **Adding filters** for deeper analysis
4. **Creating derived metrics** (ratios, trends, cohorts)

**Bottom line**: You have a solid foundation to build on, not start from scratch.
