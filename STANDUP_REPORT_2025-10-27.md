## ✅ Completed Features (Implemented Today)

### 1. Account Creation Drop-off Funnel
**Requirement:** Track at which point users drop off during account creation

**Implementation:**
- **Data Source:** `persons` table
- **Visualization:** 
  - Horizontal bar chart showing 7 funnel stages
  - Pyramid/tornado chart for visual drop-off representation
- **Stages Tracked:**
  1. Account Created
  2. Basic Info Added (name, email)
  3. Headline Added
  4. Location Added
  5. Company Added
  6. LinkedIn Connected
  7. Finder Enabled

**Query Logic:**
```sql
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total_accounts,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN first_name IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) as step_basic_info,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN headline_description IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) as step_headline,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN location_id IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) as step_location,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN company_id IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) as step_company,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN linked_in_url IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) as step_linkedin,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN has_finder = true THEN 1 END) as step_finder_enabled
FROM persons
WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;
```

**Business Value:** Identifies critical onboarding bottlenecks where users abandon the platform.

### 2. Finder - Search Actions
**Requirement:** Number of Finder searches/actions performed

**Implementation:**
- **Data Sources:** `query_embeddings`, `query_votes` tables
- **Visualizations:**
  - Search volume trend (line chart)
  - Search intent distribution (horizontal bar chart)
  - Engagement rate (doughnut chart)

**Current Metrics (UAT Data):**
- Total searches: 109
- Search intents tracked: 9 categories (EXPERTISE_SKILLS, PROFILE, ROLE_POSITION, etc.)
- Engagement rate: 20.18%
- Active users: 8

**Query Logic:**
```sql
-- Search Volume
SELECT 
    DATE_TRUNC('month', created_at) as month,
    COUNT(*) as searches
FROM query_embeddings
WHERE deleted_at IS NULL
GROUP BY month;

-- Search Intents
SELECT 
    COALESCE(intent, 'Not Specified') as intent,
    COUNT(*) as search_count
FROM query_embeddings
WHERE deleted_at IS NULL
GROUP BY intent
ORDER BY search_count DESC;

-- Engagement Rate
SELECT 
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM query_votes WHERE deleted_at IS NULL)::float / 
    NULLIF((SELECT COUNT(*) FROM query_embeddings WHERE deleted_at IS NULL), 0) * 100
    as engagement_rate_pct;
```

**Business Value:** Measures AI feature adoption and search result quality.

### 3. Profile Added to Collections
**Requirement:** Utilization of talent data via collections

**Implementation:**
- **Data Source:** `collection_profiles` table
- **Visualization:** Line chart showing monthly profile additions
- **Current Metrics:** 111 profiles added to collections

**Query Logic:**
```sql
SELECT 
    DATE_TRUNC('month', created_at) as month,
    COUNT(*) as profiles_added
FROM collection_profiles
WHERE deleted_at IS NULL
GROUP BY month
ORDER BY month DESC;
```

**Business Value:** Tracks whether users find value in talent curation features.

---

### 4. Total Collections Created
**Requirement:** Adoption of Collections feature

**Implementation:**
- **Data Source:** `collections` table
- **Visualization:** Doughnut chart with privacy breakdown
- **Current Metrics:**
  - Total: 34 collections
  - Public: 26 (76%)
  - Private: 8 (24%)

**Query Logic:**
```sql
-- Total Count
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_collections
FROM collections
WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;

-- Privacy Breakdown
SELECT 
    COALESCE(privacy, 'Not Set') as privacy_type,
    COUNT(*) as count
FROM collections
WHERE deleted_at IS NULL
GROUP BY privacy
ORDER BY count DESC;
```

**Business Value:** Indicates platform maturity and advanced feature usage.

---

### 5. Shared Collections Count
**Requirement:** Tracks collaboration activity

**Implementation:**
- **Data Source:** `collection_collaborators` table
- **Visualization:** Bar chart by access type
- **Current Metrics:**
  - Shared collections: 8
  - Total collaborations: 14
  - Access types: READ_WRITE

**Query Logic:**
```sql
-- Shared Collections Count
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT collection_id) as shared_collections
FROM collection_collaborators
WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;

-- By Access Type
SELECT 
    COALESCE(access_type, 'Not Set') as access_type,
    COUNT(*) as share_count
FROM collection_collaborators
WHERE deleted_at IS NULL
GROUP BY access_type
ORDER BY share_count DESC;
```

**Business Value:** Measures team collaboration and feature stickiness.

## ❌ Cannot Provide - Requires Application Changes

### 1. Session Duration ❌

**Requirement:** "How much time users spend on the platform"

**Why We Can't Provide It:**
The database does NOT track:
- When a user logs in
- When a user logs out
- Page views
- Time spent on each page
- Idle time vs active time

**What's Required:**

The application backend must implement **session tracking** by creating a new database table:

```sql
sessions (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY,
  person_id uuid REFERENCES persons(id),
  started_at timestamp NOT NULL,
  ended_at timestamp,
  last_activity_at timestamp,
  ip_address varchar,
  user_agent varchar,
  session_token varchar
)
```

**Backend Changes Needed:**
1. On login: Create session record with `started_at`
2. On activity: Update `last_activity_at` 
3. On logout: Set `ended_at`
4. On timeout (30 min idle): Auto-set `ended_at`

**Once Implemented, We Can Calculate:**
```sql
SELECT 
    AVG(ended_at - started_at) as avg_session_duration,
    PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY ended_at - started_at) as median_session_duration
FROM sessions
WHERE ended_at IS NOT NULL;
```

---

### 2. Complete DAU/MAU Tracking ⚠️

**Current Status:** Partially implemented

**Current Limitation:**
- We only count users who **create posts or comments**
- We CANNOT see users who:
  - Just browse/read content
  - Search using Finder (without voting)
  - View profiles
  - Update their own profile
  - Navigate the site passively

**What's Required:**

The application must log **all user activities** to track true active users:

```sql
user_activities (
  id bigserial PRIMARY KEY,
  person_id uuid NOT NULL,
  activity_type varchar NOT NULL,  -- 'login', 'page_view', 'search', 'profile_view', 'post', 'comment'
  activity_timestamp timestamp DEFAULT NOW(),
  metadata jsonb  -- additional context (page URL, search query, etc.)
)
```

**Backend Changes Needed:**
1. Log every page load
2. Log every search action
3. Log every profile view
4. Log navigation events
5. Log all user interactions (clicks, scrolls, etc.)

**Once Implemented, We Can Calculate TRUE Active Users:**
```sql
-- True Daily Active Users
SELECT 
    DATE(activity_timestamp) as date,
    COUNT(DISTINCT person_id) as true_dau
FROM user_activities
WHERE activity_timestamp >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY DATE(activity_timestamp);

-- True Monthly Active Users
SELECT 
    DATE_TRUNC('month', activity_timestamp) as month,
    COUNT(DISTINCT person_id) as true_mau
FROM user_activities
GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('month', activity_timestamp);
```

## Summary: What Engineering Team Needs to Build

### Required Backend Implementation:

**1. Session Management System**
- Track user login/logout
- Store session start/end times
- Handle session timeouts (e.g., 30 minutes of inactivity)
- Create `sessions` table in database

**2. Comprehensive Activity Logging**
- Log ALL user interactions, not just posts/comments
- Track: page views, searches, profile views, clicks
- Create `user_activities` table or enhance existing `audit_logs`
- Implement middleware to capture events automatically

**3. Database Schema Updates**
- Add `sessions` table
- Add `user_activities` table (or enhance `audit_logs`)
- Ensure proper indexing for performance

### Why This Requires Backend Work:

**You CANNOT get Session Duration or True DAU/MAU from SQL queries alone.**

The application must **actively track and store** user behavior data in real-time as users interact with the site. This is not retroactively discoverable from existing database records.

## Next Steps / Recommendations

### Immediate (Dashboard Complete):
1. ✅ Dashboard POC is production-ready
2. ✅ All feasible metrics implemented
3. ✅ Documentation complete

### Future Enhancements (Requires Engineering):
1. **Backend:** Implement session tracking system
2. **Backend:** Add comprehensive activity logging
3. **Database:** Create `sessions` and `user_activities` tables
4. **Analytics:** Re-implement DAU/MAU with complete activity data
5. **Analytics:** Add Session Duration metrics

### Product Decision Required:
- Should we prioritize backend session tracking implementation?
- Should we integrate third-party analytics (Google Analytics, Mixpanel) for immediate session/activity tracking?
